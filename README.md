# FRF-Data-Camp---Superliga-FD-app
This app is part of our project proposal for the FRF Data Camp 2025. We (Felix and I) wanted to look at developing a solution for coaches, analysts and executives working within the professional football clubs in Romania and give them a tool that can bring the complex Wyscout data to life. What you see here is the fruition of that idea.
This app allows you to visualise different types of datasets, from player advanced stats to team advanced stats, physical data and event data. Tactical insights can be gathered from using this app as you can now look to create shot maps, pass maps and networks, heatmaps and defensive actions analysis. 
For scouting needs the app has an in-built pizza plot maker where you can either use the default template or make your own analysis from a 40+ list of recognised Wyscout metrics. You can go a step further and compare players using scatter plots by filtering through their position, club and a wide range of metrics to build an in-depth report for your scouting needs.

Please note that this app was built to handle Wyscout data and the resulting csv files. Usage of other data providers will cause the app to crash.
